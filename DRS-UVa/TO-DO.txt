variation of anything with amplitude (plotted variables)

time difference between left and right --> previously channel 15 and 16...

make nanosecond binning --> picosecond binning (in auto Draw). nominal units are already picosecond

figure out what all variables are

linearTime30 is best fit?

NOTE: variables in ROOT file are arrays (36 entries, one for each channel). Figure out channel mapping, get time difference etc
