interactive commands:

single waveform: pulse->Draw("channel[10]:time[1]", "amp[10]>0.3 && event == 4984")
all waveforms of channel: pulse->Draw("channel[10]:time[1]", "amp[10]>0.3")
check if channel has waveform data: pulse->Draw("channel[10]", "amp[10]>0.3")

notes
=========
- ~2ns risetime for waveforms
- 1024 samples of each waveform per channel/group --> ~200 ps spacing
- time branch in [ns], clock branch in [ms]
- 36 channels in groups of 8, e.g. channel 0-7 in group 0, channels 8-15 in group 1, etc
- time[][1024] stored by group
- if max amp of first SiPM, e.g. channel[10]:time[1], at sample 500 and max amp of second SiPM at sample 503, 
     delta t [ns] = time[1][500] - time[1][503] --> get timestamps via readout group
- x/y coordinates in micrometers

ideas for max amp finding:
 a) simple: find largest bin
 b) simple++: find largest bin within X (12?) samples of leading edge. if largest overall, keep event, if not largest overall, throw away. --> protects against weird waveforms
 c) complicated: find max by looking for change in slope of line
